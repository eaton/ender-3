# Lab Docs

I've got a fairly well-equipped nerd cave slash home office, although I've offloaded some of the fussier equipment to the local makerspace. I use this repo document the various active and planned projects in case others want to duplicate them or (more likely) I need to remember what the heck I was thinking when I ordered a dozen tiny cooling fans from aliexpress.
