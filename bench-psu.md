# Workbench PSU

Nothing particularly fancy, but for ad-hoc tinkering, I'm currently the old 750W ATX power supply from my gaming PC, with a cheap ATX transfer board (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T4GLWF8) that breaks out screw terminals for 12V, 5V, and 3.3V power. A 3D printed case for the breakout terminals (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2440640) with some magnets glued to the bottom makes it easy to tuck things out of the way (the board sticks to the PSU case, natch).

In the future it'd be nice to make a larger case for it and tuck a cheap 24V PSU in as well; right now, there's no good way to test stuff that runs on 24V power and that includes a lot of fans and other fussy bits for the Ender.
