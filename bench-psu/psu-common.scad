/* Modular Bench PSU by Jeff Eaton - nerdhaus.net
 *
 * 0.1: 09-20-2021 Initial release.
 * 
 * The outer cases are based on yukiusagi3's parametric stackable box
 * (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3434161), which means it also
 * requires Oskar Linde's scad-utils library (available on github at
 * https://github.com/OskarLinde/scad-utils). It's a bit of a pain but
 * simplifies new module variants â€” actual parts bins, weighted bottom
 * components to prevent tipping, etc.
 *
 * This file includes shared geometry that's common across multiple
 * PSU modules, and helper code to generate placeholders and cutouts
 * for components like various jacks, boards, and so on. Actual layout
 * of each module is handled in the psu-modules.scad file; if you're
 * looking to make something custom its code is a good place to start.
 *
 * FYI, all parts and components from this file are assumed to be
 * "face up", centered on the X/Y axis. The zero point of each
 * object's Z axis should be "flush" with the surface of the case it
 * will be used with. That ensures alignment and boolean operations
 * don't need lots of special-casing.
 * 
 * The modules to generate components accept a "mode" parameter;
 * supported modes are 'cutout' for boolean operations with cases,
 * and 'placeholder' for generating previews of an assembled object.
 * Some objects also support 'mount' as a mode; it will spit out
 * screw stands or attatchment tabs, and should be added after the 
 * cutout version is subtracted from the surrounding case. 
 *
