# Ender 3 Mods

Nothing particularly fancy here, just an ongoing record of the various mods I make to a stock [Creality Ender 3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BR3F9N6) originally purchased in 2018. It's a workhorse that's pretty easy to mod, and I'd give it a big thumbs up for anyone interested in getting involved in 3D printing. Anything marked with an asterisk is a standard part of subsequent releases of the printer â€” the Ender 3 Pro, V2, etc.
